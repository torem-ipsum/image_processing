# image_processing
i dabble in editing images

In this project, I code some basic image processing functions from scratch. OpenCV library is used to read and display the images.
I learned a lot about creating and editing arrays from this! :D
The user interacts with the program to specify the types of editing made.
In the future I might try to allow for multiple edits in one go, but for now you can only do one.
